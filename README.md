Here is my repository for my custom autoclicker: Auto Clicker MAX! You can download it on my <a href="https://toxicflame427.xyz/pages/software_pages/auto_clicker.html">website</a>. I had just made this as a great way to practice (or show off ;)  ) my skills. I would have to say that this project was really fun to work on and I would like to create more things like this :)

Here is a video on my YT channel with a little demo of it working: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8gVoAY1GhU">video</a>

The hardest part of creating this was the background task of waiting for the F1 or F2 keys to be pressed without using too much RAM.
Made with C# and WinForms in Visual Studio.

All of the code I had written is in Form1.cs and HelpForm.cs, the rest of the files are for the build by Visual Studio.
- Thank you!
