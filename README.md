Here is my repository for my custom autoclicker: Auto Clicker MAX! You can download it on my <a href="https://toxicflame427.xyz/pages/software_pages/auto_clicker.html">website</a>. I had just made this as a great way to practice (or show off ;)  ) my skills. I would have to say that this project was really funto work on!

Made with C# and WinForms.

All of the code I had written is in Form1.cs and HelpForm.cs, the rest of the files are for the build by Visual Studio.
- Thank you!
